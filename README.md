Vrinda Store Sales Analysis Report 
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of Vrinda Store's sales data using Python's Pandas library to handle data manipulation and cleaning. 
The analysis began with uploading the CSV file and thoroughly examining the dataset to identify and count null values. 
I then calculated the total number of rows and columns to understand the dataset's structure. 
For the visual analysis, I used Seaborn and Matplotlib to create various charts and graphs that highlight key sales trends and patterns. 
These visualizations helped in generating meaningful insights, such as identifying peak sales periods, understanding customer purchasing behavior, and recognizing the most popular products. 
This analysis provided actionable insights that can assist in making data-driven decisions to optimize sales and improve overall business strategy.
